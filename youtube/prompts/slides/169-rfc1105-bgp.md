## Slide 1: Introduction to BGP - The First Version
- RFC 1105 from June 1989 introduces Border Gateway Protocol version 1
- Designed to replace EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol) for inter-AS routing
- Addresses limitations of previous protocols as the internet grew larger
- Developed to handle increasingly complex autonomous system topologies

## Slide 2: The Problem BGP Solves
- Late 1980s internet growth created new routing challenges
- EGP worked well for tree-like topologies but struggled with arbitrary graphs
- Need for more flexible routing between autonomous systems (AS)
- BGP enables routing in networks with multiple interconnections and redundant paths

## Slide 3: TCP as Foundation
- BGP runs on top of TCP (port 179) for reliable message delivery
- Removes need for protocol-level fragmentation and retransmission mechanisms
- TCP handles connection management and error recovery
- Simplifies BGP implementation by delegating reliability to transport layer

## Slide 4: BGP Message Types
- Open: initiates connection, exchanges AS numbers and BGP version
- Update: announces new routes or withdraws previously announced routes
- Keep Alive: maintains connection, confirms message receipt
- Notification: signals errors and terminates connection

## Slide 5: BGP Open Message Structure
- Contains BGP version number (version 1 in RFC 1105)
- Includes sender's AS number for identification
- Specifies Hold Time (seconds before connection considered dead)
- Establishes BGP speaker authentication through AS number exchange

## Slide 6: BGP Finite State Machine
- Idle: initial state before any connection attempt
- Connect: attempting TCP connection establishment
- Active: connection failed, waiting for retry
- Open Sent: TCP connected, Open message sent
- Open Confirm: Open received and validated
- Established: fully operational, exchanging updates and keep-alives

## Slide 7: Error Handling Philosophy
- Strict approach: any error triggers connection termination
- No negotiation or recovery mechanisms
- Notification message sent, then immediate disconnect
- Machine returns to Idle state, forcing complete reconnection

## Slide 8: Path Attributes and AS Path
- Update messages carry network reachability information
- AS Path attribute lists all autonomous systems the route traverses
- Enables loop detection by checking if own AS appears in path
- Supports routing policy decisions based on path characteristics

## Slide 9: Design Trade-offs and Limitations
- Simplicity prioritized over robustness in version 1
- Limited incremental update capabilities
- No sophisticated path attribute negotiation
- AS Path lists could grow large in complex topologies

## Slide 10: Historical Significance and Evolution
- RFC 1105 laid foundation for modern internet routing
- Replaced EGP as primary inter-domain routing protocol
- Basic concepts and message structure influenced subsequent BGP versions
- BGP-4 (RFC 4271) became the dominant version, still in use today

## Slide 11: Question for You
If BGP's strict error handling (immediate connection termination) was designed for simplicity, what types of transient network conditions might cause unnecessary routing instability in large-scale deployments?
