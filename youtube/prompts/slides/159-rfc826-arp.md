## Slide 1: Introduction to ARP

- RFC 826 published in 1982 by David Plummer
- Solves fundamental problem: mapping IP addresses to Ethernet MAC addresses
- Protocol operates between network layer (IP) and data link layer (Ethernet)
- Essential for delivering packets in local networks
- Design principles still relevant in modern networking after 40+ years

## Slide 2: The Core Problem: Address Translation

- IP addresses identify devices logically (network layer)
- Ethernet requires physical MAC addresses to deliver frames (data link layer)
- Question: How does a device discover MAC address for a given IP address?
- Cannot rely on centralized directories in distributed networks
- Solution must work efficiently without human intervention

## Slide 3: ARP Request: Broadcasting the Question

- Device broadcasts ARP request to all hosts on local network segment
- Broadcast ensures every device receives the query
- Request contains: sender's IP, sender's MAC, target IP
- Message asks: "Who has this IP address? Tell me your MAC address"
- Broadcast mechanism is inefficient but guarantees delivery

## Slide 4: Why Broadcast? Efficiency vs. Reliability Trade-offs

- Broadcasting generates network traffic visible to all hosts
- Alternative (point-to-point queries) would require prior knowledge
- RFC chose simplicity and reliability over optimization
- Every host processes broadcast but only target responds
- Design reflects 1982 network scale assumptions

## Slide 5: ARP Reply: Targeted Response

- Only the device with matching IP address responds
- Reply is unicast directly to requesting device (not broadcast)
- Contains target's MAC address mapping to IP
- Requester updates its ARP cache with this mapping
- Future packets can be sent directly without additional ARP queries

## Slide 6: ARP Packet Format: Minimal Design

- Fixed 28-byte packet structure (Ethernet context)
- Hardware type, protocol type, address lengths
- Operation code (request=1, reply=2)
- Sender hardware address, sender protocol address
- Target hardware address, target protocol address
- Designed for simplicity and minimal overhead

## Slide 7: Protocol Flexibility: Beyond Ethernet and IP

- RFC explicitly designed ARP to support multiple protocols
- Hardware type field: not just Ethernet (can support Token Ring, etc.)
- Protocol type field: not just IP (can support other network protocols)
- Variable-length address fields accommodate different address formats
- Forward-thinking design anticipated protocol diversity

## Slide 8: ARP Cache Management: Two Strategies

- Strategy 1: Observe all ARP traffic and cache proactively
- Advantage: reduce future ARP requests by learning from network activity
- Strategy 2: Cache only when actively communicating
- Advantage: minimal memory usage, only store needed mappings
- RFC allows implementations to choose based on resource constraints

## Slide 9: Cache Timeout and Maintenance

- Strategy 1: Use timeouts to expire old cache entries
- Prevents stale mappings when devices change or leave network
- Strategy 2: Validate cache entries before use, query if uncertain
- Active validation ensures accuracy at cost of additional traffic
- Different timeout values affect trade-off between freshness and overhead

## Slide 10: Design Philosophy: Simplicity and Resource Efficiency

- Every design choice optimized for 1982 hardware constraints
- Minimal packet size reduces processing and bandwidth requirements
- Simple state machine easy to implement in limited memory
- No complex negotiation or multi-step handshakes
- Protocol demonstrates elegant solution to fundamental networking problem

## Slide 11: Question for You

How does neighbor discovery work in massive cloud data centers with tens of thousands of machines, or in mobile ad-hoc networks where the topology and participants constantly change, making simple broadcast impractical?
