## Slide 1: BGP4 - The Constitution of the Modern Internet
- RFC 1771 published in 1995, defining Border Gateway Protocol version 4
- Inter-Autonomous System routing protocol enabling communication between independent networks
- Solves fundamental challenge: how thousands of independent networks (ISPs, universities, corporations) cooperate without central authority
- Critical evolution that prevented Internet collapse under its own growth
- Enables packets to traverse multiple independent networks from Tokyo to Buenos Aires

## Slide 2: Autonomous Systems and Inter-Domain Routing
- Autonomous System (AS): independent network with own policies and internal routing (e.g., Orange, T-Mobile, Google)
- Each AS has unique AS number (ASN) for identification
- BGP operates only between AS boundaries, not within them
- Analogy: national postal services with international postal union rules
- BGP defines how networks exchange routing information and cooperate globally

## Slide 3: Network Reachability Information and AS Path
- BGP exchanges Network Reachability Information (path attributes, not just simple announcements)
- AS Path: ordered list of all autonomous systems a route has traversed
- Functions as digital stamps from each "postal service" along the route
- Loop prevention: router immediately rejects route if its own AS number appears in AS Path
- Historical incident: Pakistan operator misdirected global YouTube traffic by announcing shortest path (2008)

## Slide 4: CIDR - Saving the Internet from Collapse
- Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) support was revolutionary for Internet survival
- Pre-CIDR: rigid address classes (A, B, C) caused massive inefficiency and routing table explosion
- CIDR enables flexible IP address blocks using IP Prefix notation
- Route aggregation: announce one large prefix instead of thousands of small networks
- Dramatically reduced global routing table size, preventing router memory exhaustion in 1990s

## Slide 5: BGP Communication Architecture
- Built on TCP port 179 for reliable, ordered message delivery
- Critical design decision: delegate transport reliability to TCP, focus on routing logic
- Four message types: OPEN, UPDATE, KEEPALIVE, NOTIFICATION
- OPEN message: initial handshake with AS number, BGP identifier, Hold Time negotiation
- Hold Time: timeout counter for detecting neighbor failures

## Slide 6: Message Types and Session Management
- KEEPALIVE: lightweight heartbeat message resetting Hold Time counter (sent cyclically)
- NOTIFICATION: error message sent immediately before closing connection (malformed header, unsupported version, invalid attributes)
- UPDATE: core message carrying routing knowledge, can announce new routes and withdraw invalid ones simultaneously
- Session failure detection: if no KEEPALIVE or UPDATE received within Hold Time, neighbor considered dead

## Slide 7: Path Attributes - Well-Known Mandatory
- AS Path: list of AS numbers traversed, critical for loop prevention and route selection
- Next Hop: IP address of border router to next autonomous system
- Origin: indicates how route entered BGP (IGP most trusted, EGP legacy, Incomplete from manual configuration)
- Every BGP implementation must understand and include these attributes
- Origin primarily used as tiebreaker in route selection process

## Slide 8: Path Attributes - Policy Control
- Local Preference (LOCAL_PREF): internal AS policy, higher values preferred (only within AS)
- Example: prefer expensive/fast Warsaw link (LOCAL_PREF 200) over cheap/slow Frankfurt backup (LOCAL_PREF 100)
- Multi-Exit Discriminator (MED): suggestion to neighboring AS about preferred entry point (lower values preferred)
- MED is optional - neighbor can ignore it based on own policy
- Demonstrates tension between cooperation and sovereignty: each AS makes final decisions based on self-interest

## Slide 9: Decision Process - Multi-Stage Route Selection
- Deterministic, multi-stage algorithm ensuring consistent decisions across routers
- Not simple shortest-path selection like internal protocols
- Stage 1: Check route validity (reachable Next Hop, no loops in AS Path)
- Stage 2: Highest LOCAL_PREF wins (internal policy is king)
- Stage 3: Shortest AS Path length (fewer systems = better path)
- Stage 4-N: Origin type, MED comparison, external vs internal neighbor, lowest BGP Identifier

## Slide 10: BGP's Enduring Architecture
- Published 1995, fundamental design remains unchanged in modern Internet
- Core concepts (AS Path, attributes, decision process) still operational today
- Enables millions of networks to communicate without central authority
- Each AS pursues self-interest, yet system functions as coherent global organism
- Truly decentralized architecture whose DNA was defined in RFC 1771

## Slide 11: Question for You
How could the Internet look different if end-user devices (laptops, phones) could actively participate in BGP routing decisions, rather than only large edge routers?
