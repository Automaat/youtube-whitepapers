## Slide 1: Introduction - The Model Zoo Problem

Content to include:

- Swiss army knife vs specialist toolbox analogy for AI models
- Traditional approach: GPT (poet - creative text generation) vs T5 (analyst - understanding, QA, summarization)
- The fundamental tradeoff: generation vs understanding - you had to choose
- Expensive maintenance: each specialized model requires separate training, resources, deployment
- Google Brain's UL2 paper challenges this paradigm - can one model do it all?

---

## Slide 2: The Core Innovation - Input-to-Target Paradigm

Content to include:

- Key insight: nearly every NLP task can be framed as "input-to-target"
- Translation, summarization, QA, text completion - all follow the same schema
- This unification enables treating diverse tasks uniformly during training
- Foundation for Mixture of Denoisers (MoD) training methodology
- Not a new architecture - revolutionary training approach ("better fuel, not better engine")

---

## Slide 3: Mixture of Denoisers (MoD) - The Training Framework

Content to include:

- Three denoising objectives combined during pre-training
- R-Denoiser (Regular): short span corruption - T5-style fundamental training
- S-Denoiser (Sequential): prefix completion - GPT-style generative training
- X-Denoiser (Extreme): long span reconstruction - bridging both paradigms
- Synergy is key: X-Denoiser alone doesn't work (confirmed by prior research)
- Athletic training analogy: marathon + sprint + extreme conditioning

---

## Slide 4: R-Denoiser - Building Foundations

Content to include:

- Regular denoising: randomly mask short spans of text
- Model learns to reconstruct missing words from local context
- Builds grammatical understanding and word relationships
- Similar to T5's original pre-training approach
- Foundation for understanding tasks (SuperGLUE, comprehension)
- "Strength training" - building the fundamental linguistic muscles

---

## Slide 5: S-Denoiser and X-Denoiser - Specialization and Flexibility

Content to include:

- S-Denoiser (Sequential): given prefix, generate coherent continuation
- Develops pure generative capabilities like GPT models
- X-Denoiser (Extreme): remove ~50% of text in one long block
- Model receives only beginning and end - must reconstruct entire middle
- Teaches broader context understanding and flexible reconstruction
- X-Denoiser bridges R (understanding) and S (generation) paradigms

---

## Slide 6: Mode Switching - Controlling Model Behavior

Content to include:

- Problem: how does trained model know which "mode" to use?
- Solution: special tokens R, S, X prepended during training
- Model learns to associate tokens with corresponding behavior modes
- At inference: use token to switch between understanding/generation modes
- Experimental proof: 48% performance difference using correct vs wrong mode
- Example: X-Sum summarization dramatically better with appropriate token

---

## Slide 7: Small-Scale Results - Proof of Concept

Content to include:

- Direct comparison with similar-sized T5 and GPT-style models
- UL2 won on 9 out of 9 different evaluation tasks
- 76% normalized performance improvement over GPT-style baseline
- Not a compromise - genuinely better across the full spectrum
- Demonstrates versatility doesn't sacrifice specialization
- Validates the Mixture of Denoisers approach at controlled scale

---

## Slide 8: UL2 20B - State of the Art Results

Content to include:

- Scaled version: 20 billion parameters
- Achieved State of the Art on 50+ different NLP tasks
- Benchmarks: MultiNews (multi-document summarization), TweetQA (informal language)
- SIQA (commonsense reasoning), SCROLLS (long document analysis)
- Versatile performance across diverse task categories
- The "Swiss army knife" proved sharper than dedicated tools

---

## Slide 9: UL2 20B vs GPT-3 - David vs Goliath

Content to include:

- GPT-3: 175 billion parameters vs UL2 20B: 20 billion (nearly 9x smaller)
- Direct confrontation on SuperGLUE benchmark (linguistic pentathlon)
- SuperGLUE tests: logic, causal reasoning, textual nuance detection
- UL2 20B won in zero-shot setting (no examples, no fine-tuning)
- First publicly available model to demonstrate Chain of Thought prompting
- Chain of Thought: model "thinks out loud" - step-by-step reasoning transparency

---

## Slide 10: Implications and Future Potential

Content to include:

- Efficiency revolution: one versatile model vs expensive model zoo
- Democratization: smaller institutions can access SOTA capabilities
- Key scientific insight: training objective may matter more than architecture
- Works across architectures: tested on both Encoder-Decoder (T5) and Decoder-Only (GPT)
- Authors acknowledge suboptimal training conditions (C4 dataset, technical issues)
- Results may be underestimating true potential of the method

## Slide 11: Question for You

What possibilities would an ideally trained UL2 model, trained on even better, more diverse and cleaner data, unlock?
