## Slide 1: The Ware Report - Dawn of Computer Security (1970)

- "Security Controls for Computer Systems" by RAND Corporation for US DoD
- Created February 11, 1970 - classified "confidential" for decades
- The "Rosetta Stone" of cybersecurity - first comprehensive security framework
- Historical context: room-sized mainframes, early time-sharing systems
- Revolutionary synthesis of security thinking vs. incremental technical solutions

## Slide 2: The Time-Sharing Revolution & New Threats

- Single computer, single user, single task → concurrent multi-user systems
- Multiple users accessing same mainframe simultaneously with different clearance levels
- Critical problem: classified documents alongside unclassified data on same machine
- Accidental or intentional information leakage becomes possible
- Need for comprehensive security model in shared computing environment

## Slide 3: Comprehensive Security Methodology

- Task force led by Willis Ware - systems architects and security analysts
- Not purely technical - required integrated, multi-layered approach
- "Anatomical atlas of vulnerabilities" - systematic security analysis
- Red team approach: attempted to break into their own systems
- Identified threat vectors, leakage points, and attack surfaces

## Slide 4: Threat Categories - Accidental vs Deliberate

- **Accidental Disclosure**: bugs, hardware malfunctions, operator errors
- Example: terminal assigned to wrong user session due to software bug
- **Deliberate Penetration**: intentional attacks by adversaries
- Active infiltration: exploiting trapdoors, backdoors in code
- Passive subversion: intercepting crosstalk, electromagnetic radiation, wire tapping

## Slide 5: Human & Organizational Attack Vectors

- Social engineering: impersonation, wiretapping, bribery
- Physical threats: "maintenance men" disabling security devices
- Revolutionary insight: "Network of trust is as important as network of cables"
- Security depends on people, processes, and technology together
- Comprehensive threat model covering technical, physical, and human factors

## Slide 6: The Harsh Verdict - Open Systems Are Insecure

- Conclusion: contemporary technology cannot guarantee security in open environments
- Only achievable security: closed environments with strict controls
- Risk of information leakage is fundamentally too high in networked systems
- Pentagon advised: no absolute security possible in open multi-user systems
- Every bug, every anomaly is a potential vulnerability

## Slide 7: Foundational Security Principles Introduced

- **System Security Officer** role formally defined for first time
- Centralized audit logging: who, when, which files accessed
- Principle of Least Privilege: minimal necessary access rights
- Multi-level security controls with strict access verification
- Personnel vetting and background checks as security layer

## Slide 8: Technical Safeguards & Best Practices

- Hardware-level security mechanisms integrated into system architecture
- Software security controls: access control lists, authentication
- Cryptographic protections for sensitive data
- Physical security: controlled access to computer facilities
- Comprehensive monitoring and anomaly detection

## Slide 9: Research Agenda for Future Decades

- Document didn't close discussion - opened doors for 20-30 years of research
- Identified critical research needs: secure data erasure from storage media
- Development of security certification methodologies
- Created roadmap for systematic security research
- Framework for continuous learning and improvement

## Slide 10: Enduring Legacy - Principles Still Valid Today

- Shifted security thinking from "locks and guards" to integrated system design
- Audit logging, least privilege, security officer role - fundamental today
- Report addressed centralized, monolithic time-sharing systems of 1970s
- Modern world: decentralized networks, cloud computing, AI, global internet
- Data is "everywhere and nowhere simultaneously" in distributed systems

## Slide 11: Question for You

Which fundamental principles from this 50+ year old report - such as centralized control, strict personnel vetting, or physical security - remain timeless in today's distributed and chaotic world, and which might become dangerously outdated?
