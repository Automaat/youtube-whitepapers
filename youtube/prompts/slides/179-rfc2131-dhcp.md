## Slide 1: Introduction to DHCP and RFC 2131
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) automates IP address assignment in networks
- RFC 2131 defines the protocol standard for dynamic network configuration
- Evolved from BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) to provide enhanced functionality
- Critical protocol for modern networks - Wi-Fi, enterprise LANs, ISP infrastructure
- Eliminates manual IP configuration and reduces administrative overhead

## Slide 2: Network Configuration Parameters
- DHCP provides complete network configuration, not just IP addresses
- Delivers subnet mask for network segmentation
- Provides default gateway for routing traffic outside local network
- Distributes DNS server addresses for domain name resolution
- Can include additional options like NTP servers, domain name, TFTP servers

## Slide 3: Address Pool Management and Lease Mechanism
- Administrator configures address pool in DHCP server settings
- Leases prevent address exhaustion in high-traffic environments
- Public Wi-Fi scenarios: devices connect/disconnect continuously
- Time-limited leases allow address reuse when devices leave network
- Lease duration configurable based on network characteristics

## Slide 4: The DORA Process - Discovery Phase
- DHCP uses 4-step process: Discovery, Offer, Request, Acknowledgment
- Step 1 (Discovery): Client broadcasts DHCP Discover message
- Broadcast reaches all devices on network segment
- Client has no IP address yet, must use broadcast communication
- Multiple DHCP servers may receive and respond to discovery

## Slide 5: The DORA Process - Offer Phase
- Step 2 (Offer): Server responds with DHCP Offer message
- Server proposes available IP address from configured pool
- Offer includes network configuration parameters (gateway, DNS, subnet mask)
- If multiple servers exist, client may receive multiple offers
- Client evaluates offers and selects one server to proceed with

## Slide 6: The DORA Process - Request Phase
- Step 3 (Request): Client sends DHCP Request message
- Request is broadcast to all devices (not unicast to chosen server)
- Announces which server's offer was accepted
- Other servers see the request and withdraw their offers
- Critical step for coordinating multiple DHCP servers on same network

## Slide 7: The DORA Process - Acknowledgment Phase
- Step 4 (Acknowledgment): Server sends final DHCP ACK message
- Confirms IP address assignment and lease terms
- Client can now configure network interface with provided parameters
- Full configuration process typically completes in milliseconds
- Client begins using assigned IP address for network communication

## Slide 8: Lease Renewal Mechanism
- Clients must renew leases before expiration
- Renewal attempts at 50% of lease duration (T1 timer)
- Client sends unicast DHCP Request directly to original server
- If renewal fails, broadcasts at 87.5% of lease time (T2 timer)
- Ensures continuous network connectivity without manual intervention

## Slide 9: DHCP Relay Agents
- DHCP relay agents extend protocol across network boundaries
- Broadcasts don't cross router boundaries by default
- Relay agent forwards DHCP messages between subnets
- Enables centralized DHCP server for multi-subnet networks
- Adds relay agent information option to track message path

## Slide 10: Robustness and Failure Handling
- Protocol handles rogue DHCP servers on network
- Client implementation determines server selection logic
- Rogue servers can disrupt network by providing incorrect configuration
- Network security measures (DHCP snooping) mitigate rogue server risks
- Proper server configuration prevents IP address conflicts

## Slide 11: Question for You
What strategies would you implement to secure DHCP in an enterprise network against rogue servers and malicious configuration?
