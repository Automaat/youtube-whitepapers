## Slide 1: Introduction to Tor and Onion Routing

- Anonymous communication system designed to protect user privacy on the internet
- Second-generation onion routing protocol improving upon original design
- Enables anonymous web browsing, hidden services, and censorship resistance
- Built on volunteer-operated relay network distributing trust across multiple nodes
- Key innovation: separating anonymity infrastructure from applications

## Slide 2: The Three-Node Circuit Architecture

- Connection routed through three Tor relays: entry guard, middle relay, and exit node
- Each relay only knows its immediate predecessor and successor in the circuit
- No single relay can link user (Alice) to destination (Bob) they're accessing
- Entry guard: knows Alice's identity but not her destination
- Exit node: knows destination but not who initiated the request
- Middle relay: knows neither source nor destination, only forwards encrypted traffic

## Slide 3: Layered Encryption and Circuit Building

- Three layers of encryption applied to data, like layers of an onion
- Each relay peels off one encryption layer using its private key
- Circuit built incrementally: first to entry guard, then extends to middle, finally to exit
- Telescoping design: extends circuit one hop at a time without revealing full path
- Only exit node sees actual destination and unencrypted application data
- Forward secrecy: ephemeral keys ensure past traffic remains secure

## Slide 4: Design Philosophy - Do One Thing Well

- Tor focuses exclusively on transport anonymity, not application-level privacy
- Applications responsible for their own data protection and anti-fingerprinting
- Strict separation of concerns: network layer vs application layer anonymity
- Exit policies allow relay operators to restrict which services they'll forward
- Users must use privacy-aware applications (Tor Browser) to avoid leaking identity
- Design enables flexibility: same network supports web browsing, messaging, file sharing

## Slide 5: Hidden Services and Rendezvous Points

- Allow servers to be accessible through Tor without revealing their location
- Service publishes descriptor to distributed hash table with introduction points
- Client and server meet at randomly selected rendezvous point in Tor network
- Both parties connect through separate three-hop circuits to rendezvous
- No party learns the other's real IP address or network location
- Enables censorship-resistant publishing and whistleblower platforms

## Slide 6: Directory Servers and Consensus

- Small set of trusted directory authorities maintain network consensus
- Publish lists of all active relays with their capabilities and performance metrics
- Clients download consensus to select relays for building circuits
- Authorities vote on relay status, detecting and excluding malicious nodes
- Consensus updated hourly, signed by majority of directory authorities
- Decentralized trust model prevents single point of control or censorship

## Slide 7: Performance vs Anonymity Trade-offs

- Low-latency design enables interactive browsing but vulnerable to timing analysis
- Circuit reuse for multiple requests improves performance but risks linkability
- Entry guards used for extended periods reduce fingerprinting but enable long-term monitoring
- Network capacity limited by volunteer relay bandwidth donations
- Adding more users improves anonymity set but may degrade performance
- Exit node bottleneck: fewer volunteers willing to run exits due to abuse complaints

## Slide 8: Threat Model and Limitations

- Protects against traffic analysis by network observers and eavesdroppers
- Does not protect against global passive adversary who can monitor all network links
- Exit node can see and modify unencrypted traffic (use HTTPS/TLS for end-to-end security)
- Vulnerable to website fingerprinting attacks analyzing traffic patterns
- Browser fingerprinting can identify users if applications leak identifying information
- Confirmation attacks possible if adversary controls both entry and exit nodes

## Slide 9: Exit Policies and Abuse Prevention

- Exit relay operators configure policies restricting which ports and protocols they allow
- Common restriction: block SMTP port 25 to prevent spam and email abuse
- Exit policies published in directory consensus for client path selection
- Reduced exit policy allows web browsing while blocking high-abuse services
- Operators can run middle-only relays to contribute bandwidth without abuse risk
- Exit flagging and reputation systems help identify and isolate malicious exits

## Slide 10: Decentralization and Trust Distribution

- Anyone can run a Tor relay, contributing to network's capacity and diversity
- Trust distributed across thousands of volunteer-operated relays worldwide
- No single entity controls enough of the network to deanonymize users
- Each user contributes to others' anonymity by adding traffic cover
- Increasing network size improves both performance and security properties
- Volunteer model creates resilience against censorship and shutdown attempts

## Slide 11: Question for You

Would we truly be safer if each of us became a small element of a global anonymizing network?
