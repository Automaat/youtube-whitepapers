Generate 11 presentation slides based on the podcast about RFC 2246 - TLS 1.0.

## Visual Style
- Minimal, clean design with dark blue headers
- White/light gray background
- Sans-serif typography throughout
- Simple outline icons only (no stock photos, no AI-generated images)
- Consistent layout: title at top, bullets left-aligned
- Same spacing and margins across all slides
- Use diagrams/flowcharts for technical concepts where appropriate

## Slide 1: Introduction to TLS 1.0
- RFC 2246 published in January 1999
- Evolution from SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) developed by Netscape
- Protocol for securing communication over the Internet
- Transition from proprietary SSL to standardized TLS

## Slide 2: The Cryptographic Foundation
- Transforms readable data into meaningless character sequences
- Protection against eavesdropping on network traffic
- End-to-end encryption between client and server
- Cryptographic primitives: encryption, authentication, integrity

## Slide 3: From Proprietary to Universal Standard
- SSL started as Netscape's internal protocol
- Became de facto industry standard in early web
- IETF standardization process created TLS
- TLS 1.0 based on SSL 3.0 with improvements

## Slide 4: The TLS Handshake - Act One
- Client initiates connection with supported cipher suites
- Server responds with chosen cipher suite and certificate
- Asymmetric cryptography (RSA) for initial key exchange
- Protocol version negotiation

## Slide 5: The TLS Handshake - Act Two
- Master secret generation from pre-master secret
- Agreed encryption rules and session keys established
- Transition from asymmetric to symmetric encryption
- Session key derivation process

## Slide 6: Symmetric Encryption - The Armored Box
- DES (Data Encryption Standard) as primary cipher
- Much faster than RSA for bulk data encryption
- Same key used for encryption and decryption
- Performance benefits for ongoing communication

## Slide 7: Forward Secrecy Considerations
- Session keys derived from master secret
- Even with RSA key compromise, past sessions remain secure
- Ephemeral key generation for each session
- Protection against future key compromise scenarios

## Slide 8: Long-term Vision and Impact
- Foundation for modern web security
- Designed with future improvements in mind
- Led to TLS 1.1, 1.2, and eventually TLS 1.3
- RFC 2246 as starting point for decades of secure communication

## Slide 9: Implementation Details
- Certificate-based server authentication
- Message authentication codes (MAC) for integrity
- Record protocol for data fragmentation
- Alert protocol for error handling

## Slide 10: Historical Significance
- 1999 document that shaped Internet security
- Standardization of previously proprietary technology
- Balance between security and performance
- Foundation for HTTPS and secure web browsing

## Slide 11: Question for You
In which scenario does the attacker have mind-reading capabilities?
