## Slide 1: Introduction to Public-Key Cryptography

- RSA introduced by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman as the first practical public-key cryptosystem
- Solves the fundamental key distribution problem in symmetric cryptography
- Each user has two keys: public key (shared openly) and private key (kept secret)
- Revolutionary breakthrough: encryption with public key, decryption with private key
- Enables secure communication without prior key exchange

## Slide 2: The Key Distribution Problem

- Traditional cryptography required secure key exchange before communication
- Problem: How do Alice and Bob share a secret key over insecure channels?
- Physical key exchange impractical for large-scale digital systems
- RSA eliminates this bottleneck by publishing public keys in a directory
- Only the private key must remain secret

## Slide 3: Mathematical Foundation

- Based on the computational difficulty of factoring large composite numbers
- Security relies on one-way function: easy to multiply primes, hard to factor products
- Public key contains modulus n = p × q (product of two large primes)
- Private key derived from knowledge of p and q
- No known efficient algorithm to compute private key from public key alone

## Slide 4: RSA Encryption Process

- Alice obtains Bob's public key (e, n) from a public directory
- Alice encrypts message M: ciphertext C = M^e mod n
- Bob decrypts using private key d: M = C^d mod n
- Mathematical guarantee: (M^e)^d ≡ M (mod n)
- Only Bob can decrypt because only he knows d

## Slide 5: Message Authentication with RSA

- RSA provides both encryption and digital signatures
- Alice signs message M using her private key: signature S = M^d mod n
- Bob verifies using Alice's public key: M = S^e mod n
- If verification succeeds, message authenticity is guaranteed
- Combines encryption and signing for secure authenticated communication

## Slide 6: Key Generation Algorithm

- Choose two large random primes p and q (typically 100+ digits each)
- Compute modulus n = p × q
- Calculate Euler's totient φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1)
- Choose public exponent e coprime to φ(n), typically e = 65537
- Compute private exponent d ≡ e^(-1) (mod φ(n)) using extended Euclidean algorithm
- Public key: (e, n), Private key: (d, n)

## Slide 7: Security Analysis and Key Size

- Security depends on difficulty of factoring n into p and q
- Paper cited fastest known factoring algorithms at the time
- Recommended key sizes: 200+ decimal digits for high security
- As of paper publication, factoring 200-digit numbers required 4 billion years
- Key size must increase over time as factoring algorithms improve

## Slide 8: Digital Signatures and Non-Repudiation

- RSA enables unforgeable digital signatures with mathematical proof
- Alice cannot deny signing a message (non-repudiation property)
- Signature verification is public - anyone can verify Alice's signature
- Critical for legal contracts, financial transactions, software distribution
- First cryptosystem to provide both confidentiality and authentication

## Slide 9: Implementation Considerations

- Modular exponentiation can be computed efficiently using repeated squaring
- Prime generation requires probabilistic primality tests (e.g., Miller-Rabin)
- Chinese Remainder Theorem can speed up decryption by factor of 4
- Padding schemes (later developed) prevent certain attacks
- Trade-off between key size and computational performance

## Slide 10: Impact on Modern Cryptography

- Became the foundation for secure internet communication (SSL/TLS)
- Enabled public-key infrastructure (PKI) and digital certificates
- Inspired development of other public-key systems (ElGamal, elliptic curves)
- Still widely used despite being over 45 years old
- Demonstrated feasibility of asymmetric cryptography in practice

## Slide 11: Question for You

What are the practical trade-offs between RSA key size and performance in modern applications, and when might alternative public-key systems be preferred?
