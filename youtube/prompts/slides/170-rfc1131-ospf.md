## Slide 1: Introduction to OSPF
- OSPF designed to solve critical problems in early routing protocols
- Dramatically slow convergence in distance-vector protocols like RIP
- Count-to-infinity problem causing routing loops
- Link-state protocol providing complete network topology view
- RFC 1131 specification published in 1989

## Slide 2: Distance-Vector Protocol Problems
- RIP only knows about directly connected neighbors
- Routing information passed hop-by-hop without global view
- Convergence time grows proportionally with network diameter
- Count-to-infinity: broken links cause iterative updates through network
- Need for 16-hop limit as "infinity" workaround

## Slide 3: Link-State Protocol Foundation
- Each router broadcasts its direct connections to entire network
- Link State Advertisements (LSAs) contain router's local topology
- Every router builds identical network topology database
- Dijkstra's algorithm computes shortest paths to all destinations
- Complete topology awareness enables fast convergence

## Slide 4: Hello Protocol and Neighbor Discovery
- Hello packets establish and maintain neighbor relationships
- Bidirectional visibility requirement: both routers must see each other
- Dead interval timeout detects failed neighbors
- Only after mutual Hello exchange can LSA exchange begin
- Foundation for reliable topology synchronization

## Slide 5: LSA Flooding Mechanism
- Router receives LSA and stores in topology database
- Immediately forwards LSA to all neighbors except sender
- Sequence numbers prevent duplicate processing
- Flooding ensures all routers receive topology updates
- Reliable flooding with acknowledgments guarantees consistency

## Slide 6: Hierarchical Design with Areas
- Networks divided into areas to limit flooding scope
- Area 0 (backbone) connects all other areas
- LSAs only flooded within single area
- Inter-area routing through Area 0 backbone
- Reduces memory requirements and CPU load on routers

## Slide 7: Backbone Area Requirement
- Area 0 must be contiguous for proper routing
- All areas must connect directly to backbone
- Packets between non-backbone areas transit through Area 0
- Virtual links can repair partitioned backbone
- Hierarchical design prevents routing loops between areas

## Slide 8: Designated Router (DR) Election
- Broadcast networks elect single DR to reduce flooding
- DR becomes central point for LSA distribution on segment
- Prevents N-squared adjacency problem on multi-access networks
- Election based on router priority and router ID
- Backup Designated Router (BDR) provides redundancy

## Slide 9: DR Election Process
- Router with highest priority wins election
- Router ID breaks ties when priorities equal
- Priority 0 routers cannot become DR
- Election triggered when segment initializes or DR fails
- All routers form adjacency only with DR and BDR

## Slide 10: Protocol Efficiency and Scalability
- LSAs contain sequence numbers for loop-free updates
- Incremental updates only for topology changes
- Periodic refresh every 30 minutes maintains database
- Area hierarchy limits routing table size
- Fast convergence compared to distance-vector protocols

## Slide 11: Question for You
Does this hierarchical simplification still make sense in modern networks?
