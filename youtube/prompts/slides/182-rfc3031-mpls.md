Generate 11 presentation slides based on the podcast about RFC 3031 - Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture (MPLS).

## Visual Style
- Minimal, clean design with dark blue headers
- White/light gray background
- Sans-serif typography throughout
- Simple outline icons only (no stock photos, no AI-generated images)
- Consistent layout: title at top, bullets left-aligned
- Same spacing and margins across all slides
- Use diagrams/flowcharts for technical concepts where appropriate

---

## Slide 1: MPLS Introduction and Historical Context
- Evolution from IP routing to label switching paradigm
- Integration of ATM switching concepts with IP networks
- Opening doors to traffic engineering and Quality of Service
- Bridge between traditional circuit switching and packet routing

## Slide 2: Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC)
- Core concept: grouping packets with identical forwarding treatment
- Independent of actual destination IP addresses
- Label assignment based on FEC classification
- Single label represents entire equivalence class of traffic

## Slide 3: Label Switching Router (LSR) Architecture
- Router operations based solely on labels, not IP addresses
- Label lookup determines next hop and outgoing label
- Separation from traditional longest-prefix-match routing
- Simplified forwarding decision process

## Slide 4: Label Stack and Operations
- Push, Pop, and Swap operations on label stack
- Multiple labels stacked for hierarchical routing
- TTL handling and decrementation in MPLS domain
- Label distribution and binding mechanisms

## Slide 5: Label Merging and Traffic Aggregation
- Multiple incoming labels mapped to single outgoing label
- Efficient resource utilization in provider networks
- Downstream router determines outgoing label
- Aggregation of flows from different sources

## Slide 6: Penultimate Hop Popping
- Label removal at second-to-last router in path
- Optimization to reduce processing at egress router
- Egress router receives native IP packet
- Performance improvement in label switching path

## Slide 7: Virtual Private Networks (VPN) Support
- Label stacking enables VPN isolation
- Outer label for provider network routing
- Inner label for customer VPN identification
- Separation of customer address spaces

## Slide 8: Label Distribution Protocols
- Multiple protocols for label distribution (LDP, RSVP-TE, BGP)
- Downstream-on-demand vs unsolicited downstream modes
- Liberal vs conservative label retention modes
- Independent vs ordered control modes

## Slide 9: Loop Prevention and TTL Processing
- TTL copied from IP header to MPLS label on ingress
- TTL decremented at each LSR hop
- TTL copied back to IP header on egress
- Loop detection through TTL expiration

## Slide 10: Control Plane vs Data Plane Separation
- Control plane: intelligence for label distribution and routing decisions
- Data plane: high-speed label switching and forwarding
- Clear separation enables specialized hardware optimization
- Control plane complexity vs data plane simplicity

## Slide 11: Question for You
Are new paradigms emerging on the horizon that blur the boundary between control plane and data plane?
