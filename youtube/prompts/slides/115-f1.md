## Visual Style

- Minimal, clean design with dark blue headers
- White/light gray background
- Sans-serif typography throughout
- Simple outline icons only (no stock photos, no AI-generated images)
- Consistent layout: title at top, bullets left-aligned
- Same spacing and margins across all slides
- Use diagrams/flowcharts for technical concepts where appropriate

## Slide 1: Introduction to Google F1

- Google's distributed relational database built on top of Spanner
- Designed to replace sharded MySQL infrastructure powering Google AdWords
- Provides ACID guarantees with global distribution
- Combines familiar SQL interface with distributed system scalability
- Revolutionary step for managing massive-scale advertising data

## Slide 2: The Pain of Sharded MySQL

- Traditional sharding required complex application-level logic
- Manual data partitioning across hundreds of MySQL instances
- Difficult to maintain consistency across shards
- Limited ability to perform cross-shard queries
- Schema changes required careful coordination and downtime

## Slide 3: F1's Architecture on Spanner

- Built on Spanner for globally distributed synchronous replication
- Survives entire datacenter failures without data loss
- Provides external consistency using TrueTime API
- Separates storage layer (Spanner) from query processing layer (F1)
- Distributed SQL query engine handles complex joins and aggregations

## Slide 4: How F1 Achieves ACID at Scale

- Uses Paxos consensus for consistent replication across regions
- TrueTime provides globally consistent timestamps
- Snapshot isolation enables consistent reads without blocking writes
- Two-phase commit protocol for distributed transactions
- Optimistic concurrency control minimizes conflicts

## Slide 5: The ORM Problem and F1's Solution

- Traditional ORMs generate inefficient query patterns at scale
- F1 encourages declarative SQL over imperative ORM code
- Supports hierarchical schema design for data locality
- Enables batching and parallel execution transparently
- Reduces network round-trips through intelligent query planning

## Slide 6: Querying Distributed Data

- Distributed join algorithms handle data spread across datacenters
- Query optimizer considers data locality and network costs
- Parallel execution across multiple F1 servers
- Support for complex aggregations and analytical queries
- Seamless integration with protocol buffers for structured data

## Slide 7: Schema Changes Without Downtime

- Online schema evolution without locking or downtime
- Multi-phase schema change protocol ensures consistency
- Supports adding/removing columns and indexes incrementally
- Rolling deployment model allows gradual migration
- Backward compatibility maintained during transition periods

## Slide 8: Latency Characteristics and Optimizations

- Higher latency than single-datacenter systems due to distribution
- Typical commit latency: 50-150ms depending on replication distance
- Read latency significantly improved through local replicas
- Batch operations and asynchronous commits reduce perceived latency
- Caching and read replicas help offset distributed system overhead

## Slide 9: Change History and Notifications

- Built-in change tracking captures all database modifications
- Publish-subscribe mechanism for downstream consumers
- Enables real-time data pipelines and materialized views
- Maintains complete audit trail for compliance
- FF Change (F1 Change) system provides transaction-level notifications

## Slide 10: Production Experience at Google

- Successfully migrated Google AdWords from sharded MySQL to F1
- Handles billions of rows and petabytes of data
- Simplified application code by eliminating sharding logic
- Improved developer productivity with standard SQL interface
- Demonstrated that distributed relational databases can work at scale

## Slide 11: Question for You

Where is the proper boundary of responsibility between the database and the application?
