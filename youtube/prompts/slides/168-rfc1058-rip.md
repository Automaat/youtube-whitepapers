## Slide 1: Introduction to RIP and Dynamic Routing
- First standardized distance-vector routing protocol for IP networks
- RFC 1058 published in 1988, codifying existing practices
- Replaced manual static routing tables with automatic convergence
- Based on Bellman-Ford algorithm for distributed distance computation
- Designed for simple implementation and ease of debugging

## Slide 2: Pre-RIP Era: Static Routing Challenges
- Before dynamic protocols, network routing was entirely manual
- Administrators configured static routes on every router individually
- Network changes required manual updates across all affected routers
- Human error and configuration drift caused frequent outages
- Scalability limited by administrative overhead and complexity

## Slide 3: Distance-Vector Fundamentals
- Each router maintains a routing table with destination networks and metrics
- Metric represents "distance" to destination (hop count in RIP)
- Routers exchange their entire routing tables with direct neighbors
- Each router updates its table based on received information plus one hop
- Convergence achieved through iterative information propagation

## Slide 4: Basic RIP Operation Example
- Router A connects to Router B, Router B connects to Router C
- Router A learns about network C through B with metric 2 (via B, distance 1+1)
- Router C learns about network A through B with metric 2 (via B, distance 1+1)
- Each router maintains next-hop information for forwarding decisions
- Simple hop-counting provides intuitive distance measurement

## Slide 5: Split Horizon Problem and Solution
- Naive distance-vector creates routing loops during topology changes
- Router C learns route to network X through B, then advertises it back to B
- If link fails, B might accept C's stale route, creating a loop
- Split Horizon rule: never advertise a route back to the neighbor who taught it
- Prevents immediate loops but doesn't solve all convergence issues

## Slide 6: RIP Protocol Mechanisms
- Periodic updates every 30 seconds broadcast full routing table to neighbors
- Triggered updates sent immediately when topology changes detected
- Maximum metric of 15 hops; 16 represents infinity (unreachable)
- Timeout mechanism: routes expire after 180 seconds without updates
- Garbage collection: invalid routes held for 120 seconds before removal

## Slide 7: Split Horizon with Poison Reverse
- Enhanced version of split horizon for faster convergence
- Instead of not advertising, router advertises unreachable routes with metric 16
- Explicitly tells neighbor "don't use me for this destination"
- Prevents counting-to-infinity problem in simple topologies
- More network traffic but significantly faster failure detection

## Slide 8: Triggered Updates and Convergence
- Immediate updates sent when route metric changes or new routes appear
- Reduces convergence time from minutes to seconds
- Random delays (1-5 seconds) prevent update storms
- Critical for minimizing packet loss during topology changes
- Complements periodic updates for reliable operation

## Slide 9: RIP Message Format and Transport
- Uses UDP port 520 for both sending and receiving messages
- Two message types: Request (query for routes) and Response (routing updates)
- Each message can contain up to 25 route entries
- Address family identifier, destination network, and metric for each entry
- Simple fixed-format structure enables easy implementation

## Slide 10: RIP Legacy and Limitations
- Dominated early Internet routing in 1980s and early 1990s
- Maximum 15-hop limit restricts network diameter
- Slow convergence and counting-to-infinity issues in complex topologies
- No support for CIDR or variable-length subnet masks (in RIP v1)
- Superseded by RIP v2, OSPF, and EIGRP for modern networks

## Slide 11: Question for You
What are the hidden costs of transitioning from a cooperation-based system?
