## Visual Style

- Minimal, clean design with dark blue headers
- White/light gray background
- Sans-serif typography throughout
- Simple outline icons only (no stock photos, no AI-generated images)
- Consistent layout: title at top, bullets left-aligned
- Same spacing and margins across all slides
- Use diagrams/flowcharts for technical concepts where appropriate

## Slide 1: The Internet Protocol - RFC 791

- Foundational specification for IP addressing and packet routing
- Published in September 1981 as part of TCP/IP protocol suite
- Defines how data is transmitted across interconnected networks
- Core principles: best-effort delivery, connectionless datagram service
- Designed for heterogeneous network environments with varying technologies

## Slide 2: The Addressing Problem

- How to uniquely identify every device on the internet?
- RFC 791's solution: hierarchical IP address structure
- 32-bit addresses enabling billions of unique identifiers
- Two-part addressing: network portion and host portion
- Gateway routing based on network prefixes

## Slide 3: Network and Host Separation

- Devices in the middle (routers) only need network information
- Edge devices (hosts) handle full address resolution
- Efficient routing through hierarchical lookup tables
- Routers forward based on network portion only
- Final delivery uses complete address at destination network

## Slide 4: Address Classes A, B, and C

- Class A: first bit 0, large networks with few network IDs
- Class B: first bits 10, medium networks, balanced allocation
- Class C: first bits 110, small networks with many network IDs
- Class determines split between network and host portions
- Different classes for different organizational needs

## Slide 5: Security Classifications in IP Headers

- Security field with levels: Unclassified, Confidential, Secret, Top Secret
- Compartmentalization for need-to-know access control
- Handling restrictions encoded in packet headers
- Military and government network requirements
- Transmission control authorities (TCA) field

## Slide 6: Fragmentation and Reassembly

- Fragments can arrive in completely different order
- Identification field groups fragments from same original packet
- Fragment Offset indicates position in original datagram
- MF (More Fragments) flag signals more fragments coming
- Reassembly happens only at final destination

## Slide 7: The Fragment Offset Mechanism

- Measured in 8-byte blocks for header compression
- 13-bit field allows up to 65,536 bytes maximum datagram size
- Combined with flags to track fragment boundaries
- First fragment has offset 0, MF flag set
- Last fragment has MF flag clear

## Slide 8: Time to Live (TTL) Counter

- 8-bit counter preventing infinite routing loops
- Sender sets initial value (e.g., 64 or 128)
- Each router decrements by 1 when forwarding
- Packet discarded when TTL reaches 0
- ICMP Time Exceeded message sent back to source

## Slide 9: Why Header Checksum Only?

- Verifying payload at every router would be expensive
- Header correctness is critical for routing decisions
- Payload verification delegated to transport layer (TCP)
- Checksum recalculated at each hop as TTL changes
- Trade-off between speed and end-to-end reliability

## Slide 10: The Options Field

- Variable-length extensions to standard 20-byte header
- Source routing: sender specifies path through network
- Record route: each router adds its address to list
- Timestamp: track timing through network path
- Security options for classified networks
- Options processing optional for receiving software

## Slide 11: Question for You

What trade-offs do you see in IP's design choice of verifying only the header checksum at each router instead of validating the entire packet payload?
