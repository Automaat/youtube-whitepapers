Generate 11 presentation slides based on the podcast about RFC 793 - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

## Visual Style

- Minimal, clean design with dark blue headers
- White/light gray background
- Sans-serif typography throughout
- Simple outline icons only (no stock photos, no AI-generated images)
- Consistent layout: title at top, bullets left-aligned
- Same spacing and margins across all slides
- Use diagrams/flowcharts for technical concepts where appropriate

## Slide 1: Introduction to TCP

- RFC 793 defines TCP protocol for reliable data transmission
- Designed for robustness in the presence of communication failures
- Works on top of IP layer to provide connection-oriented service
- Fundamental protocol powering modern internet communication

## Slide 2: Core Design Principles

- Robustness in the presence of communication errors and network failures
- Connection-oriented protocol ensuring reliable data delivery
- Handles packet loss, duplication, delay, and reordering
- Built for longevity - designed to work in completely unknown future network conditions

## Slide 3: Reliable Delivery Mechanism

- Sender transmits data packets with sequence numbers
- Receiver sends ACK (acknowledgement) for received packets
- Sender doesn't care about packet contents, only if they arrived
- Retransmission occurs if ACK not received within timeout

## Slide 4: Three-Way Handshake

- Establishes connection before data transmission
- SYN: Client initiates connection request
- SYN-ACK: Server acknowledges and accepts connection
- ACK: Client confirms, connection established

## Slide 5: Flow Control with Sliding Window

- Window mechanism prevents overwhelming the receiver
- Receiver advertises available buffer space
- Sender limits data in flight to window size
- Dynamic adjustment based on receiver capacity

## Slide 6: Handling Lost Acknowledgements

- Timeout-based retransmission for lost packets
- If ACK not received, sender retransmits data
- Prevents indefinite waiting for missing acknowledgements
- Critical for maintaining connection reliability

## Slide 7: Sequence and Acknowledgement Numbers

- Each byte of data has unique sequence number
- Acknowledgement number indicates next expected byte
- Enables precise tracking of transmitted and received data
- Handles out-of-order delivery and duplicate detection

## Slide 8: Connection Termination

- FIN flag signals intention to close connection
- Graceful shutdown with acknowledgement exchange
- Both sides can independently close their transmission
- Ensures all data delivered before connection closes

## Slide 9: RST - Connection Reset

- RST flag forcefully terminates connection
- Used when connection becomes invalid or corrupted
- Immediate termination without graceful shutdown
- Error handling mechanism for exceptional situations

## Slide 10: Port Numbers and Multiplexing

- Port numbers enable multiple connections on same host
- Combination of IP address and port uniquely identifies connection
- Allows concurrent communication with multiple services
- Foundation for socket programming and network applications

## Slide 11: Question for You

Will TCP continue to serve as the foundation of internet communication for decades into a completely unknown future?
