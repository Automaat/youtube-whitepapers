## Visual Style
- Minimal, clean design with dark blue headers
- White/light gray background
- Sans-serif typography throughout
- Simple outline icons only (no stock photos, no AI-generated images)
- Consistent layout: title at top, bullets left-aligned
- Same spacing and margins across all slides
- Use diagrams/flowcharts for technical concepts where appropriate

## Slide 1: IPv6 - Redesigning the Internet Foundation
- RFC 2460 published December 1998 - fundamental internet specification
- Not just about more addresses - complete protocol redesign opportunity
- IPv4 address exhaustion: running out of unique identifiers globally
- Design philosophy: rethink network architecture from ground up
- Vision for future internet scalability and efficiency

## Slide 2: IPv4 Problems That IPv6 Addresses
- Address space exhaustion - IPv4's 32-bit addresses insufficient
- Complex header structure requiring processing at every router
- Fragmentation handling overhead distributed across network nodes
- Lack of built-in security and quality of service mechanisms
- Inefficient routing due to header complexity and options processing

## Slide 3: IPv6 Header - Simplification Through Redesign
- Fixed 40-byte header (vs IPv4's variable 20-60 bytes)
- Only 8 fields compared to IPv4's 13 fields
- Removed: header checksum, options, fragmentation fields from base header
- Streamlined processing: routers only examine essential fields
- Consistent structure enables faster hardware processing

## Slide 4: Address Space Expansion - 128-bit Addresses
- IPv4: 32 bits = ~4.3 billion addresses
- IPv6: 128 bits = 340 undecillion addresses (3.4 × 10³⁸)
- Hierarchical address structure for efficient routing
- Enough addresses for every device, sensor, IoT endpoint
- Eliminates need for NAT workarounds in most scenarios

## Slide 5: Extension Headers - Modular Design Philosophy
- Core header remains fixed, extensions added as "train cars"
- Next Header field creates chain of optional headers
- Examples: Hop-by-Hop Options, Routing, Fragment, Destination Options
- Only processed by nodes that need them (except Hop-by-Hop)
- Enables protocol extensibility without breaking base specification

## Slide 6: Fragmentation - End-to-End Responsibility
- IPv4: routers fragment packets when needed, reassembly at destination
- IPv6: fragmentation only by source node, never by intermediate routers
- PATH MTU Discovery determines maximum packet size for path
- Minimum MTU requirement: 1280 bytes (vs IPv4's 576 bytes)
- Shifts complexity from network core to endpoints

## Slide 7: Router Processing Efficiency
- Routers skip most extension headers - only examine routing headers
- No checksum recalculation at each hop (removed from IPv6)
- Fixed header structure enables fast hardware lookups
- Reduced processing overhead improves forwarding performance
- Design optimizes for common case: simple packet forwarding

## Slide 8: Upper Layer Protocol Considerations
- TCP and UDP require checksum recalculation for pseudo-header
- Pseudo-header includes: source/destination addresses, payload length, next header
- ICMPv6 becomes integral part of IPv6 (not optional like in IPv4)
- No backward compatibility with IPv4 at protocol level
- Upper layer protocols must be IPv6-aware

## Slide 9: Quality of Service - Traffic Class and Flow Label
- Traffic Class field (8 bits): packet priority and handling
- Flow Label field (20 bits): identify packet flows for QoS
- Enables differentiated services and real-time traffic handling
- Routers can apply consistent treatment to flow packets
- Built-in support for modern application requirements

## Slide 10: The IPv6 Migration Challenge
- RFC published 1998, yet IPv4 still dominates in 2025
- Not a technical problem - technology ready for decades
- Economic, operational, and psychological barriers
- Global scale infrastructure cannot be simply "turned off"
- Chicken-and-egg problem: content vs connectivity adoption

## Slide 11: Question for You
Why, in 2025, are we still in the midst of a slow and often painful migration from IPv4 to IPv6, with much of the internet still running on the old protocol?
