```text
Create a YouTube thumbnail (16:9 aspect ratio) in Dandadan anime style.
Use the uploaded dog photo as reference - transform into anime style with
superhero deep green cape and futuristic visor.
White background. The dog reveals information hiding - modules concealing
design decisions, interfaces protecting against change, modular boundaries
glowing. Write the text "INFO HIDING" in bold, slate gray, angular anime font
in upper left. Modularity architect pose, encapsulation energy, bold linework.
No clutter.
```

**Text:** INFO HIDING | **Color:** Slate Gray
