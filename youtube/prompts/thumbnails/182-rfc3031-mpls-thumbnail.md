Create a YouTube thumbnail (16:9 aspect ratio) in Dandadan anime style.
Use the uploaded dog photo as reference - transform into anime style with

White background. The dog attaches labels to packets, label-switched paths
cutting through network, forwarding based on short labels not IP lookup.
Write the text "MPLS" in bold, label cyan, angular anime font in upper left.
Label switching pose, fast forwarding energy, bold linework. No clutter.
