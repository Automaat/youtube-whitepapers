```text
Create a YouTube thumbnail (16:9 aspect ratio) in Dandadan anime style.
Use the uploaded dog photo as reference - transform into anime style with
superhero green tech cape and futuristic visor.
White background. The dog makes procedure calls across machine boundaries,
RPC stubs glowing as transparent network abstraction bridges.
Write the text "RPC" in bold, lime green, angular anime font in upper left.
Remote caller pose, location transparency energy, bold linework. No clutter.

**Text:** RPC | **Color:** Lime Green
