# Thumbnail Prompt: Life Beyond Distributed Transactions

```text
Create a YouTube thumbnail (16:9 aspect ratio) in Dandadan anime style.
Use the uploaded dog photo as reference - transform into anime style with
superhero pink tech cape and futuristic visor.
White background. The dog breaks free from transaction chains, embracing
eventual consistency and entity-centric workflows floating freely.
Write the text "NO 2PC!" in bold, liberation green, angular anime font in upper left.
Freedom breaker pose, post-transaction enlightenment energy, bold linework. No clutter.
```

**Text:** NO 2PC! | **Color:** Liberation Green
