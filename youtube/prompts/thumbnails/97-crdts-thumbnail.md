# Thumbnail Prompt: CRDTs

```text
Create a YouTube thumbnail (16:9 aspect ratio) in Dandadan anime style.
Use the uploaded dog photo as reference - transform into anime style with
superhero pink tech cape and futuristic visor.
White background. The dog merges conflicting data versions that magically
converge into one, concurrent edits flowing together without conflicts.
Write the text "AUTO MERGE" in bold, merge purple, angular anime font in upper left.
Conflict resolver pose, eventual consistency energy, bold linework. No clutter.
```

**Text:** AUTO MERGE | **Color:** Merge Purple
