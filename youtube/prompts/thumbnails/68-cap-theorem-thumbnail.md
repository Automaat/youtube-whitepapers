# Thumbnail Prompt: CAP Theorem

```text
Create a YouTube thumbnail (16:9 aspect ratio) in Dandadan anime style.
Use the uploaded dog photo as reference - transform into anime style with
superhero pink tech cape and futuristic visor.
White background. The dog stands at center of a triangle with C, A, P at
vertices, forced to choose only two glowing paths. Impossible choice drama.
Write the text "PICK TWO!" in bold, electric orange, angular anime font in upper left.
Impossible choice pose, tradeoff tension energy, bold linework. No clutter.
```

**Text:** PICK TWO! | **Color:** Electric Orange
