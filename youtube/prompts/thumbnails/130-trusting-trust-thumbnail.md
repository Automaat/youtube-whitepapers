# Thumbnail Prompt: Reflections on Trusting Trust

```text
Create a YouTube thumbnail (16:9 aspect ratio) in Dandadan anime style.
Use the uploaded dog photo as reference - transform into anime style with
superhero red tech cape and futuristic visor.
White background. The dog stares at a compiler that compiles itself,
infinite mirrors of code reflecting backdoors within backdoors.
Write the text "TRUSTING TRUST" in bold, paranoia purple, angular anime font in upper left.
Recursive doubt pose, compiler inception energy, bold linework. No clutter.
```

**Text:** TRUSTING TRUST | **Color:** Paranoia Purple
