Create a YouTube thumbnail (16:9 aspect ratio) in Dandadan anime style.
Use the uploaded dog photo as reference - transform into anime style with

White background. The dog broadcasts "Who has this IP?" while mapping
IP addresses to MAC addresses, address resolution table glowing.
Write the text "ARP" in bold, ethernet yellow, angular anime font in upper left.
Broadcast pose, address resolution energy, bold linework. No clutter.
