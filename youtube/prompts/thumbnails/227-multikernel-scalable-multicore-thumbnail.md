Create a YouTube thumbnail (16:9 aspect ratio) in Dandadan anime style.
Use the uploaded dog photo as reference - transform into anime style with
superhero green tech cape and futuristic visor.
White background. The dog treats cores as distributed system with message passing,
no shared kernel state, replicated data structures shown as synchronized copies.
Write the text "BARRELFISH" in bold, forest green, angular anime font in upper left.
Multicore architect pose, message-passing scalability energy, bold linework. No clutter.

**Text:** BARRELFISH | **Color:** Forest Green
