Create a YouTube thumbnail (16:9 aspect ratio) in Dandadan anime style.
Use the uploaded dog photo as reference - transform into anime style with
superhero deep green cape and futuristic visor.
White background. The dog organizes cylinder groups across a spinning disk,
inodes and data blocks clustered together for locality, Berkeley FFS radiating
performance. Write the text "FFS" in bold, forest green, angular anime font
in upper left. Cylinder group architect pose, locality optimization energy,
bold linework. No clutter.
