# Thumbnail Prompt: MapReduce

```text
Create a YouTube thumbnail (16:9 aspect ratio) in Dandadan anime style.
Use the uploaded dog photo as reference - transform into anime style with
superhero pink tech cape and futuristic visor.
White background. The dog splits data into map shards then dramatically
combines them back in reduce phase, data flowing in hourglass pattern.
Write the text "MAP→REDUCE" in bold, data flow cyan, angular anime font in upper left.
Data orchestrator pose, parallel processing energy, bold linework. No clutter.
```

**Text:** MAP→REDUCE | **Color:** Data Flow Cyan
