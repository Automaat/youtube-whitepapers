# Thumbnail Prompt: DNS Implementation

```text
Create a YouTube thumbnail (16:9 aspect ratio) in Dandadan anime style.
Use the uploaded dog photo as reference - transform into anime style with
superhero orange tech cape and futuristic visor.
White background. The dog implements DNS resolver, query packets flying
to authoritative servers, zone files and resource records glowing.
Write the text "RESOLVE" in bold, server blue, angular anime font in upper left.
Implementation pose, query resolution energy, bold linework. No clutter.
```

**Text:** RESOLVE | **Color:** Server Blue
