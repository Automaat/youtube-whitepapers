```text
Create a YouTube thumbnail (16:9 aspect ratio) in Dandadan anime style.
Use the uploaded dog photo as reference - transform into anime style with
superhero red tech cape and futuristic visor.
White background. The dog smashes through a stack of memory blocks,
shellcode injection arrows piercing through buffer boundaries.
Write the text "STACK SMASHING" in bold, exploit red, angular anime font in upper left.
Buffer overflow pose, return address hijack energy, bold linework. No clutter.
```

**Text:** STACK SMASHING | **Color:** Exploit Red
