# Thumbnail Prompt: Programming Semantics for Multiprogrammed Computations

```text
Create a YouTube thumbnail (16:9 aspect ratio) in Dandadan anime style.
Use the uploaded dog photo as reference - transform into anime style with
superhero green tech cape and futuristic visor.
White background. The dog defines semaphore symbols glowing in the air,
P and V operations orchestrating process synchronization barriers.
Write the text "SEMAPHORES" in bold, forest green, angular anime font in upper left.
Synchronization architect pose, mutual exclusion energy, bold linework. No clutter.
```

**Text:** SEMAPHORES | **Color:** Forest Green
