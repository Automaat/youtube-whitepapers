Create a YouTube thumbnail (16:9 aspect ratio) in Dandadan anime style.
Use the uploaded dog photo as reference - transform into anime style with
superhero green tech cape and futuristic visor.
White background. The dog constructs minimal kernel with IPC as foundation,
user-space servers glowing as modular components communicating via messages.
Write the text "L4" in bold, olive green, angular anime font in upper left.
Minimal kernel architect pose, IPC efficiency energy, bold linework. No clutter.
