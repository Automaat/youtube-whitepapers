```text
Create a YouTube thumbnail (16:9 aspect ratio) in Dandadan anime style.
Use the uploaded dog photo as reference - transform into anime style with
superhero deep green cape and futuristic visor.
White background. The dog shares engineering wisdom - "Keep it simple",
"Get it right", "Don't hide power", principles radiating from Lampson's
decades of experience. Write the text "HINTS" in bold, sage green, angular
anime font in upper left. Design wisdom pose, engineering principles energy,
bold linework. No clutter.
