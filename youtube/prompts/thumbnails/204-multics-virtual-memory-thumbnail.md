# Thumbnail Prompt: Multics Virtual Memory

```text
Create a YouTube thumbnail (16:9 aspect ratio) in Dandadan anime style.
Use the uploaded dog photo as reference - transform into anime style with
superhero deep green cape and futuristic visor.
White background. The dog stands within a two-dimensional addressing grid,
segment numbers glowing on one axis, page indices on the other, forming
a protective matrix. Write the text "SEGMENTATION" in bold, cyan, angular
anime font in upper left. Virtual memory architect pose, address space energy,
bold linework. No clutter.
```

**Text:** SEGMENTATION | **Color:** Cyan
