# Thumbnail Prompt: DNS Concepts

```text
Create a YouTube thumbnail (16:9 aspect ratio) in Dandadan anime style.
Use the uploaded dog photo as reference - transform into anime style with
superhero orange tech cape and futuristic visor.
White background. The dog navigates hierarchical domain tree, root at top
branching into TLDs (.com, .org, .net), names resolving to IP addresses.
Write the text "DNS" in bold, domain teal, angular anime font in upper left.
Navigator pose, name resolution energy, bold linework. No clutter.
```

**Text:** DNS | **Color:** Domain Teal
